# NLP---DeepLearning-sentiment-analysis
NLP project that allows to analyse tweets and classify them whether they are or not about actual disasters using neural networks.

## Details for certification

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Data

The data file is provided by the Kaggle Competition
* https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started
* tweeter.csv for model traing and validation is in the repo if access to the competition URL is not possible 

### Prerequisites

The source code is written in Python 3
The python packages can be installed with pip : pip3 install or !pip install if in jupyter notebook
I recommand you run the notebook in Google Collab for better speed and computationnal capacities

### Installing

The needed libraitries to be installed are in the requirements.txt file

## Deployment

If you need to deploy this repo, you will have to use the datastet in the repo called tweeter.csv

## Built With

Projet_tweets_main.ipynb :
* Loads and automates data vizualisation
* Creates a new dataset after preprocessnig the text data
* Trains 3 different neural networks with Tensorflow Keras and compares their performances after optimization.
